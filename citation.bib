  abstract = {'<p>'<p>OBJECTIVES ': 'The objective of this study was to determine the strength of evidence on the effectiveness of two policy levers—the experience rating of workers’ compensation insurance and the enforcement of occupational health and safety regulation—in creating incentives for firms to focus on health and safety issues. </p> '<p>'<p>METHODS ': 'An extensive systematic literature review was undertaken in an effort to capture both published and grey literature studies on the topic. Studies that met specific subject-matter and methods criteria underwent a quality assessment. A qualitative approach to evidence synthesis, known as “best-evidence” synthesis, was used. This method ranks the strength of evidence on a particular topic on the basis of the number, quality, and consistency of studies on the topic.</p> '<p>'<p>RESULTS ': 'There was moderate evidence that the degree of experience rating reduces injuries, limited to mixed evidence that inspections offer general and specific deterrence and that citations and penalties aid general deterrence, and strong evidence that actual citations and penalties reduce injuries.</p> '<p>'<p>CONCLUSIONS ': 'Although experience rating is a key policy lever of those providing workers’ compensation insurance, there is much to be learned about its merits. Few studies have concerned the topic, and most have used crude proxy measures or exploited natural experiments. There have been many more studies on the merits of regulation enforcement, even though here too measures were often crude. Nonetheless, this synthesis indicates that general deterrence is less effective in reducing injury incidence and severity, whereas specific deterrence with regard to citations and penalties does indeed have an impact.</p>},

  abstract = {This study explores teacher learning in Vocational Education and Training colleges, combining organizational and psychological factors, such as transformational leadership, teamwork, and self-efficacy. 447 teachers participated in a survey study. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to test 7 hypotheses derived from previous research. The results show that transformational leadership has direct and indirect effects on teacher learning as mediated by teamwork processes. Moreover, the impact of teamwork processes on teacher learning was mediated by self-efficacy. The study contributes to research on workplace learning by giving insight into the role organizational and psychological factors play in stimulating teacher learning.}

  abstract = {Aim To examine the relationships between leader–member exchange (LMX), workplace learning options (teamwork, training and development), empowerment and organisational commitment, for nurses in Australia, England and Brazil. Background The supervisor–employee relationship is fundamental to management theory and practice within the work context of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Methods Survey-based, self-report data were collected from 1350 nurses in 23 acute-care hospitals during 2011. Results Significant relationships were found between key Social Exchange Theory antecedents (LMX and teamwork) and outcomes (organisational commitment) for nurses in Australia and England, but not in Brazil. As expected, the path between teamwork and organisational commitment was significant in the three countries. Conclusions The findings affirm the importance of LMX as a management tool affecting employee outcomes in OECD countries. In contrast, LMX cannot be assumed to play an important role within a context that operates a dual employment structure coupled with a culture accepting of ‘Jeitinho’ workplace relationships. Implications for nursing management Informal workplace relationships – ‘Jeitinho’ (similar to the Chinese ‘guanxi’) may be worthy of examination within BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries such as Brazil.},
