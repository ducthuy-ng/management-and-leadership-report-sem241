Learning and education are among the key leadership factors that require special attention, as they
enable organizations to adapt quickly to changes. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
educational institutions faced significant shifts, such as transitioning to online learning, which
emphasized the urgent need for leaders to swiftly adapt to new technologies and teaching strategies.
Leaders had to collaborate and encourage teachers not only to adopt technology, but also to develop
flexible teaching skills and foster creative learning environments for students. Therefore, the aim
of this paper is to analyze the role of leadership in promoting learning to ensure adaptability and
growth in changing conditions.
